## Overview
The game board consists of 9 squares arranged in 3 rows and 3 columns. Two players participate in the game, taking turns to place their symbols ("X" and "O"). The goal of each player is to achieve a sequence of three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line. If neither player succeeds in doing so and the game board is filled - there is no winner. If one of the players wins or there is no winner after all squares are filled, the game proceeds to the "winner" page, where if there is a winner, their name is displayed, otherwise it states that there is no winner. Then, it redirects back to the main page, where a new game begins.

If someone attempts to access the "winner" page before the game has ended, it restarts from the beginning.
